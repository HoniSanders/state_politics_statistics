[partisan lean data](partisan_lean.csv):

This could definitely use a better data source.  This source is not precise, and does not have historical data.

[abortion laws](abortionlaws.csv):  
from https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/abortion-laws-by-state  
This could definitely use a better data source.  Quantification of abortion accessibility and quantification of different laws is necessary.
